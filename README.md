# assessment-back-end

For this project, I used .NET CORE 2.2 technology, for a Restfull HTTP service, it can be used for mvc views, controllers.
I tried to show a DDD methodology, I thought about leaving a business logic for the future, I separated into Repositories, Controllers and Models. User authentication is done through cookies.

I created a small console project for use in testing. The idea is to enter an apiUrl and then authenticate through a clientId, in the project there are several comments you can test how to use it.
